0.   Simulation primer-target binding activity by thermodynamics

  Thermodynamics has been proved to be a reliable method to predict the oligo hybridization properties.

  Primer misprimer, self dimers and cross dimers all of them were measured by thermodynamics in MPRIMER

0.   Genome-wide checking the primer specificity and dimers

  A k-mer index algorithm was developed to speed up the binding sites search against the large genome database.

0.   Genome-mediated dimers finding algorithm

  Thermodynamics was used to measure the stability of the misprimer and dimers

0.   Has a virtual electrophoresis function to predict the mobility of amplicon

  Virtual agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of each amplicon to prevent the overlap bands

0.   Designs a flexible plugin mechanism for easily extending the applications of MPRIMER

  With powerful parameters of Primer3, MPRIMER implements a flexible plugin mechanism, which can easily extend the applications of MPRIMER

  For example, with a simple script, users can extend the MPRIMER to design primers for SNP genotyping

0.   Auto-groups templates into different tubes when they are incompatible

  In the case of incompatible templates (e.g. due to high sequence similarity), MPRIMER can separate them automatically

0.   High-throughput primer design

  The MPRIMER pipeline enables design hundreds of primers automatically without any human interference.
